Call Center Data Analysis Using Power BI

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing call center data to uncover key performance metrics and provide actionable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of call center operations. By leveraging Power BI, I created interactive dashboards and reports that offer a comprehensive view of various call center metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve overall customer service and agent performance.

Objectives
Analyze Call Center Performance: Evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as overall customer satisfaction, call resolution rates, average speed of answer, and agent performance.
- Identify Trends and Patterns: Discover trends in call volumes, peak call times, and factors affecting customer satisfaction.
- Agent Performance Analysis: Assess agent efficiency by analyzing average handle time, call resolution rates, and the number of calls answered.

 Data Description

The dataset includes the following key columns:
- Agent ID: Unique identifier for each call center agent.
- Date and Time: Timestamp of each call.
- Topic: The subject matter of the call.
- Answered (Y/N): Indicator of whether the call was answered.
- Call ID: Unique identifier for each call.
- Resolved (Y/N): Whether the issue was resolved during the call.
- Speed of Answer: Time taken to answer the call, measured in seconds.
- Average Talk Duration: Average duration of conversations between agents and customers.
- Satisfaction Rating: Customer satisfaction score, typically on a scale of 1 to 5.

Analysis Highlights

- Customer Satisfaction: Calculated the overall customer satisfaction score and identified factors that contribute to higher or lower satisfaction levels.
- Call Resolution: Analyzed the resolution rates across different call topics and identified areas for improvement.
- Agent Performance Quadrant: Created a quadrant analysis comparing agents' average handle time against the number of calls answered to identify top performers and areas needing improvement.
- Call Time Analysis: Visualized call volumes by time of day to identify peak periods and ensure adequate staffing during high-demand hours.

Results and Insights

- Improved Agent Training:** Insights from the analysis highlighted the need for targeted training for agents with lower resolution rates, particularly in specific call topics.
- Optimized Call Handling:** By identifying peak call times, recommendations were made to adjust staffing levels to reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction.
- Enhanced Performance Metrics:** The quadrant analysis helped in recognizing top-performing agents, which can be used for incentive programs and setting benchmarks for others.

Tools Used

- Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Power Query: For data cleaning, transformation, and preparation within Power BI.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculating custom metrics and KPIs.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in optimizing call center operations. By using Power BI, I was able to turn raw data into meaningful insights that can help improve customer satisfaction, streamline call handling processes, and enhance overall call center performance.
